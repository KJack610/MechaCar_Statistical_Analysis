Linear Regression to Predict MPG
a. Overview:The purpose of this analysis to analyze the impact of the variables on miles per gallon.
b. The vechile length and ground clearance both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. These varoiables have a significant relaitonship with mpg.
c. The linear model is is not 0. The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is less than the .05 thresholds( This indicates that there 95% chance the observed results happened not as a result of chance). The p-value from this model indciates there is a significant relationship between the variables and mpg.
Yes, since the r-squared value is  .7149, the model is able to correctly predict mpg predictions about 71.5% the time. 

Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The variance for the suspension coils is 62.293 for the whole manufacturing lot, which will meet the specifications.
The variance for for Lot 1 (.979) and Lot 2 (7.46) will also meet the specificaiton requirements. However, the variaance for Lot 3 is 170.2 and this does not meet the specification requirements.

T-Tests on Supsension Coils
T-tests are tests that used  determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is a parametric test in which the goal is reject Ho. The pvalue needs to reject the Ho is .05. However, based on this result, we fail to reject th e null hypothesis.

In Lot 1 the p-value is 1, In Lot 2, the p-value is .60. Both p-values are significant greater than the threshold .05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In Lot 3, the p value is 0.04 and we can reject Ho since it is lower than the threshold. 

Study Design Mechanism
 a. Metrics to test
 DV: ost, 
 IV: mpg, maintenance cost, mpg onn the street and mpg on the highway, carbon emmissions.
 b. Hypothesis:
 Ho: The cost is not different based on the variables
 Ha: There is a difference is cost based the variables.
 c. Data Collected:
Need an adequate sample size to establish valdility, would need data on the variables listed above. Need to determine the distribution of the data to determine the best type of statistical analysis to run.
